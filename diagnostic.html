<ul style="color: black; font-size: 20px; font-family: arial">   Computer-aided detection (CADe), also called computer-aided diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images. </br> Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information </br> that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. </br> CAD systems process digital images for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.   </br></br>
