<ul style="color: black; font-size: 20px; font-family: arial">In medicine, a prosthesis or prosthetic implant
 is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may be lost through trauma, disease, or a condition present at birth.
 Prostheses are intended to restore the normal functions of the missing body part.
 Amputee rehabilitation is primarily coordinated by a physiatrist as part of an inter-disciplinary
 team consisting of physiatrists, prosthetists, nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists.
 Prostheses can be created by hand or with computer-aided design (CAD), a software
 interface that helps creators design and analyze the creation with computer-generated 2-D and 3-D
 graphics as well as analysis and optimization tools.</br></br>
