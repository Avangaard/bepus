<ul style="color: black; font-size: 20px; font-family: arial">3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model. </br>
 The term "3D printing" can refer to a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, </br>
 with material being added together (such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together), typically layer by layer.</br></br>
